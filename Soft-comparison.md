|  | **MakeFile** | **Ansible-playbook** | **Chezmoi** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Goal:** | Manage project dependencies | Manage servers configurations | Manage dotfiles |
|  |  |  |  |
| **Desc:** | Good to setup project dependencies. It allows to install packages, create dir, set env vars... | Ansible role/tasks are good but it feels to be overkill for a laptop install. It's stateful and created to manage servers pool. | Chezmoi is very good to manage dotfiles and allow versionning, save etc.. His first goal is to share dotfiles accross multiple clients/servers so it's not my goal. But it can't preinstall for me packages over all Linux distrib |
